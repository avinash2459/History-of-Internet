# Search Engines History

Seeing an opportunity in the World Wide Web and browsers, several search engines were introduced to the world of Internet.

## Yahoo

*Jerry Yang and David Filo from Stanford University, started the first Internet Search Engine called “Yahoo”. Even though it's new to the web, Yahoo had instant success.*

*Later Yang and Filo promoted advertising in Yahoo to make money on the web with the help of Michael Moritz, a venture capitalist. Yahoo’s users multiplied which resulted in a growth in advertisers.*

## Excite

*Excite was introduced as a competitor to Yahoo and this search engine has automated the process of search using WEB when a query is given by the user.*

*Both the companies Yahoo and Excite launched Mail Engines to take their company ahead. But both companies lost their focus and efficiency in their main feature “Search Engine” resulting in mismatched search.*

## Google

*Larry Page and Sergey Brin, from Stanford developed Google. Google is a search Engine which has far better logic than Yahoo and Excite, when queried, it results in the websites which are more popular(based on voting).*

*Vinod Khosla, venture capitalist, worked with Google to better their search approach by joining Excite to beat Yahoo. But Excite failed to buy Google as Larry Page wanted Excite's search technologies to be replaced by Google's, to which George Bell, then-CEO of Excite, did not agree. *

*Google got an investment from Andy Rubin and worked on their search engine further. They have organised all the information in the world and made it searchable.Later Michael Moritz, a venture capitalist, Invested a huge amount of 12 Million for Google’s progress.*

*Google later used the search keywords named “Adwords” to make business using marketing research. This theory was copied by Google from Bill Gross, founder of idealab. Companies used to pay to show their links as sponsored at the top of the search list. Google generated a huge revenue from this Adwords.*

*On August 19, 2004, Google went public (IPO) by listing their shares after which they went to 3 billion dollars annual revenue.*

*Google started their other projects like Google Library, Google Books, Gmail, Google Docs, Google Maps, Picasa, Youtube which resulted in their world domination.*
