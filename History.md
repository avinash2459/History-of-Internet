# Internet history

*During early days, computers were as large as a room, and only a very few places used to have them as they cost a fortune.In the early 90’s, the communication in telephone has been operating through a technique called circuit switching, this technique makes sures that once communication is established between 2 nodes, it will be held until it is ended on one side. This requires an active connection throughput.In 1962, Leonard Kleinrock of MIT, published a paper on packet switching technique which is connectionless and works on packets instead of circuits. The key idea is to make the computers talk with each other.Later Barren used the idea of telegram and worked on sending the data through packets by chopping them. Each packet contains the information and header. Each packet contains to and from address so that each node can decide and send the data from sender to recipient. Each node is used to store the copy of data so that the data can be sent until the packet arrives successfully to another node*

*In 1969, time sharing was introduced, where the computer responds within 2 seconds when an input is given in the terminal. Later Taylor thought of building a network where the computers in the network should be able to communicate with each other. Taylor recruited L Roberts, who built the world's first experimental connection between computers in MIT. Mini Computers were introduced to connect with each other via network as it is difficult to connect large computers, and these mini computers were connected to the large computers via time sharing.Later Roberts made the engineers build the ARPANET that is based on mini computers called Interface Message Processors(IMP’s) using packet switching. Using this long data is chopped into packets and sent separately. Each packet launched into the network operates independently and finds its destination in the network. The destination will attach the packets and will send it to the recipient. A company BBN came front and got the contract to build this idea.By the end of 1969, all 4 nodes where interconnected and it worked.*

*By 1971, ARPANET had 18 mainframe computers connected to the network.Later using the same technique, an app was developed called “EMAIL”. This email became the killer app for ARPANET. RFC(Request For Comments) was introduced which is to get ideas/bugs from the users so that the technology can be improved.Later, the development of computer networks took off and had a growth in the western part of the world. LAN’s were introduced to link computers through offices and WAN’s were used to link computers across buildings.In 1973, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, developed a set of rules called TCP/IP protocols, if followed by computers, they can transfer data to and fro. TCP/IP enabled the networks to interconnect, the computer and network which uses protocol can be communicated via “Gateway”.In 1983, TCP/IP was adopted as a universal standard so that the Internet can be unified.*

*In 1992, the Internet was released to the public, which unleashed a lot of progress.This resulted in a lot of developments in the internet. Desktops were introduced for easy access of computers via ethernet.The World Wide Web is introduced which enables users to access websites using a link. This gave the internet a capability beyond file transfer and emails. Still in 1992 there were only 52 websites.In 1993, a web browser called MOSAIC was introduced which helped users to access content. This turned the internet into a graphically rich world which can display text, scroll bars and links to access. This increased the usage of WEB to 350%*
